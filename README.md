# An-Immersed-Boundary-Method-by-phi-FEM-approach-to-solve-the-heat-equation

## Python codes 

  Implementations of phi-FEM and standard FEM to solve the Heat equation in different case :

  - `Phi_Fem_Heat_Equation_BDF2.py` : on a circle, using a BDF2 discretization in time;
  - `Phi_Fem_Heat_Equation_Circle_Theta_Scheme.py` : on a circle, using the theta-scheme (implicit Euler or Crank-Nicolson for example);
  - `phi_fem_heat_equation_on_shark.py` : on a shark, using implicit Euleur in time;
  - `Phi_Fem_Heat_Equation_Rectangle.py` : on a rotated rectangle using implicit Euler in time;
  - `Phi_Fem_Heat_Equation_Sphere.py` : on a sphere using implicit Euler in time.

## Text file 

The file `test_cases.pdf` contains some details about the previous test cases and essentially the schemes used to solve the Heat equation for each test case and the corresponding numerical results.
